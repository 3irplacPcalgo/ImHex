## Method 1: Using the Offline Installer
 
The offline installer is a standalone package that contains all the files and components needed to install .NET Framework 3.5 on your system. You can download it from the official Microsoft website[^1^]. Here are the steps to use the offline installer:
 
1. Download the offline installer from [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/dotnet-35-windows). Make sure to choose the correct language and version for your system.
2. Run the downloaded file and follow the instructions on the screen. You may need to restart your computer after the installation is complete.
3. Verify that .NET Framework 3.5 is installed on your system by going to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features > Turn Windows features on or off. You should see a check mark next to .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0).

## Method 2: Using the Windows Features Dialog
 
The Windows features dialog is a built-in tool that allows you to enable or disable certain features of Windows, including .NET Framework 3.5. However, this method requires an Internet connection, as it will download the necessary files from Windows Update. Here are the steps to use the Windows features dialog:

1. Press the Windows key on your keyboard, type "Windows Features", and press Enter. The Turn Windows features on or off dialog box will appear.
2. Select the .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0) check box, and click OK. You may see a pop-up asking you to install this feature. Choose Install this feature to proceed.
3. Wait for the installation to finish. You may need to restart your computer after the installation is complete.
4. Verify that .NET Framework 3.5 is installed on your system by going to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features > Turn Windows features on or off. You should see a check mark next to .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0).
